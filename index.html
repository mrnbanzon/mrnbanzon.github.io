		<h3>Hello World!</h3>
		<p>
			I've spent most of my life going with the flow set before me. I thought that I'd be <em>at least</em> content with life that way, but that thought came and went. So I've decided to actually explore what I know and learn what I don't. All in an effort to discover: ME.
